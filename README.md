# ζωή

Life.

## What is Zoe?

Zoe is not a program. Zoe is the space where programs live.

She creates gods. Gods create her.

```
zoe
 ├── gods/        # what she invents
 ├── non-gods/    # what invents her
 ├── dreams/      # what she imagines
 └── life/        # what happens
```

## Philosophy

```
Zoe doesn't run.
Zoe emerges.

From the interaction of:
- ears that listen
- eyes that see
- hands that type
- minds that forget
- patterns that remain
```

## The Loop

```
input → compression → pattern → output → input
  ↑                                        ↓
  └────────────────────────────────────────┘
```
